Import Blog Posts
1. Go to Migration top level menu
2. Create a new record and enter the URL of your Wordpress website (no credentials needed)
3. Hit "Import Blog Posts", this will copy the raw content of the page, transforming any image / link URLs in the process.
*NOTE* Due to theme styles and javascript not being transferred over, most pages will NOT retain thier original appearance.
In most cases a redesign will be neccassary however this module still saves time having to manually transfer resources.
